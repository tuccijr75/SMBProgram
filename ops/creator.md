## Your Content AI Workflow

### Session Setup
1. New session → paste AIWorkflowRules.md
2. Paste your brand voice canon
3. Set the content type and audience

### Stage 1: Ideation (temperature 0.7–1.0)
```
ROLE: Creative strategist, unconventional thinker.
TASK: Generate 10 content angles for [TOPIC].
CONTEXT: Audience: [WHO]. Platform: [WHERE]. Goal: [WHAT ACTION].
Recent content: [WHAT YOU'VE ALREADY COVERED].
CONSTRAINTS: 1. No generic angles ("5 tips for...").
2. At least 3 contrarian or unexpected angles.
3. Each angle: one-sentence pitch + why it works.
FORMAT: Numbered list: angle + rationale.
```

### Stage 2: Outline (temperature 0.2–0.4)
```
ROLE: Content architect, logical, structured.
TASK: Build an outline for: [SELECTED ANGLE].
CONTEXT: Audience: [WHO]. Target length: [WORDS]. Format: [TYPE].
Key points to cover: [LIST].
CONSTRAINTS: 1. Hook concept in first line. 2. One core point per section.
3. Data/example placement for each section. 4. Logical flow between sections.
FORMAT: Hook | Sections (header + key point + evidence slot) | CTA
```

### Stage 3: Draft (temperature 0.3–0.5)
```
ROLE: [Your brand voice description — e.g., "Direct B2B writer, data-first"].
TASK: Write [CONTENT TYPE] following this outline: [PASTE OUTLINE].
CONTEXT: Voice guide: [PASTE FROM CANON].
CONSTRAINTS: 1. Match this reference paragraph: [PASTE EXAMPLE].
2. Active voice. 3. Sentences under 20 words avg.
4. One idea per paragraph. 5. [WORD COUNT] words.
6. No filler phrases. 7. Hook in first sentence.
FORMAT: Title | Body (following outline sections) | CTA
```

### Stage 4: Edit (temperature 0.1–0.2)
Run three separate editing passes:

**Pass 1 — Structure:**
```
"Review for flow: Does each section connect to the next?
Is the hook strong? Does the CTA follow naturally?
Flag structural issues only."
```

**Pass 2 — Voice:**
```
"Compare this draft against the voice guide: [PASTE].
Flag any sentences that don't match the voice.
Check: active voice, sentence length, filler phrases."
```

**Pass 3 — Accuracy:**
```
"Verify every factual claim. Flag any claim without a source.
Check: data accuracy, proper attribution, no fabrication."
```

## Weekly Content Sequence
1. **Monday:** Ideation for the week's content
2. **Tuesday:** Outlines for all pieces
3. **Wed–Thu:** Draft (one piece per session, fresh context)
4. **Friday:** Edit all pieces (3-pass system)

## Key Files to Maintain
- `AIWorkflowRules.md` — personal rules
- `BrandVoice.md` — voice guide + reference paragraphs
- `ContentCalendar.md` — topics, dates, status
- `WritingMaster.txt` — reusable writing prompt
- `EditChecklist.md` — your 3-pass editing criteria

## Voice Consistency Tips
1. Include a **reference paragraph** in every drafting prompt
2. Use the **same voice description** across all content types
3. Keep a **vocabulary list**: words to use, words to avoid
4. Compare new drafts against published pieces quarterly

## Expected Time Savings
- Ideation: 30 min → 10 min (with better angles)
- Outlining: 20 min → 5 min
- Drafting: 2 hours → 30 min (per 1,000 words)
- Editing: 45 min → 15 min (3-pass system)
- Weekly total: ~10 hours → ~3 hours for same output volume

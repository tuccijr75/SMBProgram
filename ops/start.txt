AI SESSION STARTUP CHECKLIST
FLX AI Studio AI Workflow Mastery
================================================

Use this checklist every time you begin an AI
session for important work. Takes 2 minutes.
Prevents the most common quality failures.

================================================

BEFORE YOU TYPE ANYTHING


[ ] 1. START A NEW SESSION
     Don't continue yesterday's conversation.
     Fresh context = better results.

[ ] 2. PASTE YOUR RULEBOOK
     Your personal AI operating rules (.md file).
     This sets baseline behavior for the session.

[ ] 3. PASTE YOUR PROJECT CANON (if applicable)
     Identity, rules, decisions, style guide, status.
     This is your project truth document.

[ ] 4. PASTE ROLLING SUMMARY (if continuing a project)
     Under 100 words. What was done, key decisions,
     open issues. This replaces conversation history.

================================================

BEFORE YOUR FIRST PROMPT
-------------------------

[ ] 5. IDENTIFY YOUR TASK TYPE
     [ ] Writing    -> Use writing pipeline or WritingMaster
     [ ] Coding     -> Use Spec->Plan->Code->Test or CodingMaster
     [ ] Research   -> Use anti-hallucination chain or ResearchMaster
     [ ] Strategy   -> Use decision memo framework or StrategyMaster
     [ ] Operations -> Use SOP/checklist workflow
     [ ] General    -> Use role + context + constraints + format

[ ] 6. GATHER YOUR SOURCE MATERIAL
     Upload files when possible (best quality).
     Paste text when upload isn't available.
     Never rely on the AI's memory of past sessions.

[ ] 7. CHOOSE YOUR MODEL TIER
     [ ] Quick/simple task -> Lightweight model
     [ ] Analysis/coding   -> Reasoning model
     [ ] Creative work      -> Mid-tier, higher temperature

================================================

WRITING YOUR PROMPT
-------------------

[ ] 8. INCLUDE ALL FOUR ELEMENTS
     [ ] ROLE:        Who the AI should be
     [ ] CONTEXT:     Specific details and data
     [ ] CONSTRAINTS: Numbered rules (5-10)
     [ ] FORMAT:      Exact output structure

[ ] 9. ADD FAILURE HANDLING
     "If [X] is missing, ask for it. Don't guess."
     "If unsure, say so. Don't fabricate."

[ ] 10. ADD VERIFICATION STEP
      "Before delivering, verify: [checklist]."

================================================

DURING THE SESSION
------------------

[ ] Re-anchor instructions every 10-15 turns
[ ] Watch for drift signals (tone, format, rule violations)
[ ] Save good outputs immediately (don't trust the session)
[ ] If quality drops, don't push through -- new session

================================================

SESSION CLOSE
-------------

[ ] Save all outputs to project folder
[ ] Write rolling summary for next session
[ ] Update canon with new decisions
[ ] Note any prompt improvements for next time

================================================
Build systems, not just prompts.

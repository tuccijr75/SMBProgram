- Phase 1 initialized: ops files, canon, rulebook, checklist, drift protocol, prompt folders, and task templates created.
- Canon locked v0.1 slice and site information architecture.
- Default build recommendation documented: docs-first GitHub site, no backend v1 (pending final framework approval).
- Docusaurus v0.1 scaffold created in repo with docs-first IA, Week 1 page, starter templates/rubrics, and GitHub Pages workflow.
- Local build verified in a `/tmp` mirror due WSL `/mnt/d` npm rename permission errors; generated `package-lock.json` copied into repo for CI.
- Phase 3 content system drafted: updated week template, added lab/project templates, added gates rubric, expanded labs rubric, and fully rewrote Term 1 Week 1 (Product Thinking for SMB AI).

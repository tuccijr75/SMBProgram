# Rolling Summary
> Keep under 100 words. Replace this after each session.

Phase 3 content system is now in place. Added reusable `week`, `lab`, and `project` templates; expanded rubric set with `labs` and new `gates`; and fully rewrote `term1/w01` as Product Thinking for SMB AI with measurable objective, pain categories, ROI framing, must-have vs nice-to-have filter, tool archetypes, assignment requirements, artifact list, rubric summary, competency gate pass criteria, hours, and ship checklist. Updated docs changelog and prepared this session summary draft.

Initialized Phase 1 operating system for the SMB AI Tool Builder Program site. Created project rules, canon, drift recovery, context checklist, prompt folders, and task packet templates. Canon locks 36-week program structure, GitHub docs-first site approach, and v0.1 build slice. Next step is Phase 2: finalize site framework (default Docusaurus), create docs IA in repo, and prepare Codex scaffold task packet.

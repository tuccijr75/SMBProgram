Docusaurus v0.1 scaffold was added for the SMB AI Tool Builder site: core config, docs structure, Week 1 page with required sections, template/rubric starters, portfolio/term placeholders, and GitHub Pages workflow. Existing `docs/ops` files were preserved. Build succeeds in a `/tmp` mirror (`npm install`, `npm run build`); a WSL `/mnt/d` npm rename-permission issue blocked direct install in repo, so `package-lock.json` from the successful mirror install was copied into the repo for CI use.

DRIFT RECOVERY CARD — SMB PROGRAM SITE
================================================

Drift = output stops matching canon, page templates, or task scope.

DETECTION SIGNALS
-----------------
[ ] Missing required week/page sections
[ ] Tone/style changed from canon
[ ] Added unapproved features/scope
[ ] Ignored file structure or naming rules
[ ] Replaced templates with ad hoc formats
[ ] Long output with no verification step

SEVERITY
--------
MILD: 1 issue -> restate the missing constraint
MODERATE: multiple issues -> re-inject rules + canon
SEVERE: off-scope / contradicts canon -> start new session

RECOVERY PROTOCOL
-----------------
STEP 1 — DETECT
"Compare your last output to these rules/templates and list violations."

STEP 2 — RE-ANCHOR
"Follow ALL rules in ops/rules.md and ops/canon.md for the remaining task."

STEP 3 — REGENERATE
"Regenerate the last output exactly to the required format. Do not add scope."

STEP 4 — VERIFY
"List each required section/rule and mark PASS or FAIL."

COPY-PASTE RECOVERY PROMPT
--------------------------
STOP. Re-read these files and follow them exactly:
- ops/rules.md
- ops/canon.md
- [relevant template file]

Your recent output violated these requirements: [list].
Regenerate the output. Before delivering, verify every required rule/section
and mark PASS or FAIL.

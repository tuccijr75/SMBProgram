# Labs Rubric

## Objective

Provide a consistent, weighted grading standard for weekly labs.

## Required Deliverables for Scoring

- Lab output artifacts listed in the week/lab page
- Verification evidence (screenshots, logs, or table outputs)
- Short written rationale for decisions made

## Rubric

| Criterion | Weight | What "Meets" Looks Like |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| Problem framing quality | 25% | Problem is specific, scoped, and tied to a real SMB workflow |
| Execution quality | 25% | Steps are completed correctly and output is usable |
| Evidence and verification | 20% | Claims are supported by clear, checkable evidence |
| ROI and priority reasoning | 15% | Tradeoffs and value logic are explicit and defensible |
| Documentation quality | 15% | Deliverables are organized, readable, and reviewer-ready |

## Scoring Guidance

- 4 = Exceeds expected quality with strong evidence
- 3 = Meets requirements with minor gaps
- 2 = Partially complete; significant corrections needed
- 1 = Incomplete, unclear, or not reviewable

## Pass Criteria

- Weighted score >= 80/100
- No score below 2 in `Problem framing quality`, `Execution quality`, or `Evidence and verification`
- All required deliverables submitted

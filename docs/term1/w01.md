# W01: Product Thinking for SMB AI

Module 1 focuses on identifying high-value SMB pain before any build work begins.

## Goal (Measurable Objective)

Produce a ranked opportunity brief with **20 pain statements** across **2 SMB verticals**, including ROI hypotheses, priority ranking, and tool-archetype mapping.

## Competency Gate

Demonstrate the ability to translate qualitative SMB pain into a prioritized, defensible build roadmap.

## Competencies

- Convert raw observations into clear pain statements.
- Classify pain into practical SMB pain categories.
- Frame value with simple ROI assumptions.
- Distinguish must-have pain from nice-to-have requests.
- Map high-priority pain to realistic AI tool archetypes.

## Concepts

### SMB Pain Categories

| Category | Core Signal | Typical Business Impact |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Revenue leakage | Leads or opportunities are missed | Lost revenue and lower close rate |
| Time waste | Repetitive admin tasks consume staff time | Higher labor cost and slow turnaround |
| Error and rework | Manual work produces inconsistent outputs | Refunds, rework hours, trust loss |
| Customer friction | Slow response or unclear communication | Churn, poor reviews, low referrals |
| Visibility gaps | Owner cannot see pipeline/ops status quickly | Slow decisions and missed interventions |

### ROI Framing

Use simple assumptions and show your math.

- Weekly value estimate = `(hours saved x hourly cost) + revenue recovered + risk cost avoided`
- Monthly ROI estimate (%) = `((monthly value - monthly tool cost) / monthly tool cost) x 100`

### Must-Have vs Nice-to-Have

Use this filter for each ranked pain item.

| Test | Must-Have Signal | Nice-to-Have Signal |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Frequency | Happens daily/weekly | Happens occasionally |
| Cost of delay | Clear financial/operational penalty | Low immediate consequence |
| Buyer urgency | Owner would pay now to fix | Interest exists but urgency is low |
| Workaround quality | Current workaround fails often | Current workaround is acceptable |

### Tool Archetypes

Use these archetypes to map pain to likely solution direction.

- Intake and triage assistant
- Quote and proposal copilot
- Scheduling and follow-up automation
- Customer response assistant
- SOP and knowledge copilot
- KPI and exception monitor

## Labs

1. **Pain Mining Lab:** Capture raw SMB workflow pains from two selected verticals.
2. **ROI Hypothesis Lab:** Build first-pass ROI assumptions for top pain items.
3. **Priority Filter Lab:** Classify top items as must-have vs nice-to-have.

## Build Assignment

Create an opportunity brief for two SMB verticals.

### Required assignment outputs

1. Write **20 pain statements** total (`10 per vertical`).
2. Score each pain statement with a ranking model.
3. Select top opportunities and map each to a tool archetype.
4. Choose and justify the two verticals you will continue with in Term 1.

### Ranking model (required)

Score each item from `1-5` on:

- Severity (business damage)
- Frequency (how often it occurs)
- Willingness to pay (buyer urgency)

Total score = `Severity + Frequency + Willingness to pay`.

### Pain statement format (**SIMULATED** example)

`When a busy HVAC owner receives after-hours leads, response delay exceeds 12 hours, causing lost booked jobs.`

## Deliverables (Required Artifacts)

- `pain-list.md` with 20 pain statements
- `rank-sheet.csv` with scoring columns and totals
- `verticals.md` with rationale for chosen two verticals
- `archetypes.md` mapping top pain items to tool archetypes
- `roi-note.md` with ROI hypotheses for at least top 6 items

## Rubric Summary

Primary rubric: `rubrics/labs`

| Criterion | Weight |
| --- | ---: |
| Problem framing quality | 25% |
| Execution quality | 25% |
| Evidence and verification | 20% |
| ROI and priority reasoning | 15% |
| Documentation quality | 15% |

## Pass Criteria (Competency Gate)

To pass Week 1:

- All required artifacts are submitted and reviewable.
- Exactly 20 pain statements are provided across two verticals.
- Ranking sheet includes all required scoring fields and totals.
- Must-have vs nice-to-have classification is applied to at least top 10 items.
- At least one ROI hypothesis per vertical is documented.
- Rubric score is `>= 80/100`, with no critical criterion below threshold.

## Hours

Estimated effort: **10-12 hours**.

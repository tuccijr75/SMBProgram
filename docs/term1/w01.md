# W01 Product Thinking for SMB AI

Module 1 establishes the decision process used throughout the program: **find painful, frequent, expensive SMB problems before writing code**.

---

## Week Outcome (Measurable Objective)

By the end of Week 1, you will produce a **ranked opportunity brief** covering **2 SMB verticals** with:

- **20 pain statements** total (10 per vertical)
- scoring for **Severity / Frequency / Willingness to Pay**
- **must-have vs nice-to-have** classification for top opportunities
- **tool archetype mapping** for top opportunities
- **ROI hypotheses** for at least top 6 opportunities

### Competency Gate
You can convert messy, qualitative business pain into a **prioritized and defensible build roadmap**.

---

## Why This Week Matters

Most AI builders fail because they start with:
- a cool model,
- an automation idea,
- or a feature list,

instead of starting with:
- a painful operational bottleneck,
- clear buyer urgency,
- and measurable business value.

This week prevents that mistake.

---

## Prerequisites

You should have:

- a local folder for this program repo/site
- basic spreadsheet access (Excel / Google Sheets / CSV editor)
- ability to edit Markdown files
- willingness to use **simulated examples** if you do not yet have real business interviews (label them clearly)

---

## Tools You Will Use This Week

- Markdown editor (for `.md` files)
- Spreadsheet tool (for `.csv`)
- Timer (phone timer is fine)
- Optional: ChatGPT for brainstorming *raw pain examples only* (you still do the scoring and filtering)

---

## Time Budget (Target 10-12 Hours)

### Suggested breakdown
- **1.0h** - Pick and justify 2 verticals
- **2.5h** - Pain mining (raw capture)
- **2.0h** - Convert raw notes into clean pain statements
- **2.0h** - Scoring + ranking
- **1.5h** - Must-have vs nice-to-have classification
- **1.5h** - ROI hypotheses + archetype mapping
- **1.0h** - Final artifact QA + submission pack

---

## Deliverables (Required Artifacts)

Create these files for Week 1:

- `pain-list.md` - 20 pain statements (10 per vertical)
- `rank-sheet.csv` - scoring sheet with totals + rank
- `verticals.md` - rationale for chosen verticals
- `archetypes.md` - top pain items mapped to tool archetypes
- `roi-note.md` - ROI hypotheses for at least top 6 items

> If examples are hypothetical, label them **SIMULATED**.

---

## Competencies (What You Must Demonstrate)

- Convert raw observations into clear pain statements
- Classify pain into practical SMB pain categories
- Frame value with simple ROI assumptions
- Distinguish must-have pain from nice-to-have requests
- Map high-priority pain to realistic AI tool archetypes

---

## Core Concepts (Reference)

### SMB Pain Categories

| Category | Core Signal | Typical Business Impact |
|---|---|---|
| Revenue leakage | Leads/opportunities are missed | Lost revenue, lower close rate |
| Time waste | Repetitive admin consumes staff time | Higher labor cost, slow turnaround |
| Error and rework | Manual work creates inconsistent outputs | Rework, refunds, trust loss |
| Customer friction | Slow response / unclear communication | Churn, bad reviews, low referrals |
| Visibility gaps | Owner lacks fast operational visibility | Slow decisions, missed intervention |

---

### ROI Framing (Use simple assumptions and show your math)

#### Weekly value estimate
`Weekly value = (Hours saved x hourly cost) + revenue recovered + risk cost avoided`

#### Monthly ROI estimate (%)
`Monthly ROI % = ((Monthly value - Monthly tool cost) / Monthly tool cost) x 100`

> You are not proving exact finance this week.  
> You are proving you can build a **reasonable first-pass business case**.

---

### Must-Have vs Nice-to-Have Filter

| Test | Must-Have Signal | Nice-to-Have Signal |
|---|---|---|
| Frequency | Happens daily/weekly | Happens occasionally |
| Cost of delay | Clear financial/operational penalty | Low immediate consequence |
| Buyer urgency | Owner would pay now | Interest exists, urgency low |
| Workaround quality | Current workaround fails often | Workaround is acceptable |

---

### Tool Archetypes (Use for mapping)

- Intake and triage assistant
- Quote and proposal copilot
- Scheduling and follow-up automation
- Customer response assistant
- SOP and knowledge copilot
- KPI and exception monitor

# Exact Step-by-Step Instructions

## Step 1 - Pick 2 SMB Verticals (60 minutes)

### Objective
Choose **two verticals** you will analyze in Week 1 and continue using in Term 1 examples.

### Instructions
1. Create `verticals.md`.
2. Brainstorm **8-12 possible SMB verticals**.
3. Score each vertical from **1-5** on:
   - pain intensity
   - operational complexity
   - repeatability of workflows
   - buyer accessibility (how easy for you to reach/understand)
4. Select **top 2** based on total score + your interest.
5. Write a short rationale for each selected vertical.

### Recommended starter verticals (if unsure)
- Home Services (HVAC, plumbing, roofing, electrical)
- Medspa / Dental
- Legal intake (small law firms)
- Auto shop
- Real estate team

### `verticals.md` required structure

# Week 1: Program Setup and First AI Utility

## Goal

Establish the development workflow and ship one small AI utility with reproducible setup steps.

## Competencies

- Set up local toolchain and repository workflow.
- Call at least one external API and capture response data.
- Produce structured output from an LLM prompt.
- Document setup and usage in a README.

## Concepts

- Program operating rules and competency gates
- API request/response fundamentals
- Prompt-to-structure patterns
- Minimal testing and verification habits

## Labs

1. Environment and repo setup check.
2. API request lab with logged response payload.
3. Prompt design lab that outputs structured JSON.

## Build Assignment

Build a small SMB-facing utility that takes one user input and returns one actionable result using an API + LLM step.

## Artifacts

- Source code repository
- Setup and run instructions
- Sample input/output set
- Short reflection: what worked, what failed, what changed

## Rubric

Use `rubrics/labs` as baseline scoring guidance.

## Pass Criteria

- Utility runs locally without manual fixes by reviewer.
- Output structure matches documented schema.
- README allows another user to reproduce results.

## Hours

Estimated effort: 8-12 hours.

## Ship Checklist

- [ ] Repo link provided
- [ ] Repro steps validated
- [ ] Sample runs included
- [ ] Rubric self-score attached

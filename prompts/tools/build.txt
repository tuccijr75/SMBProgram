====================================================
MASTER PROMPT BUILDER v1.0
FLX AI Studio — AI Workflow Mastery
====================================================

PURPOSE:
This is a meta-prompt. Use it to generate new master
prompts for any task. It produces a complete 7-component
master prompt from your task description.

====================================================
HOW TO USE
====================================================

1. Fill in the TASK DESCRIPTION section below
2. Paste this entire file into an AI session
3. The AI will generate a complete master prompt
4. Stress-test the generated prompt (see section below)
5. Repair any failures
6. Compress for daily use

====================================================
TASK DESCRIPTION (fill this in)
====================================================

TASK:
[Describe the task in 2–5 sentences. What does it produce?
How often do you do it? What does "good" look like?]

Example: "I write weekly client status reports for 8 clients.
Each report summarizes progress, flags risks, and lists
action items. Good reports are under 500 words, data-driven,
and require no follow-up questions from the client."

AUDIENCE:
[Who reads/uses the output? What is their expertise level?]

QUALITY STANDARDS:
[What makes the output good? Be specific.]

COMMON PROBLEMS:
[What usually goes wrong when you do this task?]

EXAMPLE INPUT:
[Optional: Paste one example of the input you typically provide]

EXAMPLE OUTPUT:
[Optional: Paste one example of excellent output]

====================================================
GENERATION PROMPT (send this to the AI)
====================================================

Generate a complete master prompt with ALL 7 components
for the task described below. Follow these requirements:

COMPONENT 1 — ROLE:
Define a specific professional role with clear expertise
and approach attributes. Not vague ("helpful assistant")
but specific ("senior financial analyst, data-driven,
conservative, flags assumptions explicitly").

COMPONENT 2 — SCOPE:
List what the prompt covers (IN SCOPE) and what it does
not cover (OUT OF SCOPE). Be explicit about boundaries.

COMPONENT 3 — CONSTRAINTS:
Write 8–12 numbered rules that govern every output.
Include: tone, format, length, sourcing requirements,
anti-failure rules. Each rule must be specific and
testable (not "be professional" but "third-person,
no contractions, formal vocabulary").

COMPONENT 4 — OUTPUT SCHEMA:
Define the exact structure of every output. Use a
template format with section names and descriptions.
The model fills this template — it is not a suggestion.

COMPONENT 5 — FAILURE HANDLING:
Write explicit instructions for at least 5 failure
scenarios: missing data, ambiguous input, out-of-scope
requests, conflicting instructions, and one domain-
specific failure mode.

COMPONENT 6 — VERIFICATION:
Create a checklist of 6–8 items the model must verify
before delivering. Include: constraint compliance,
format compliance, data accuracy, and completeness.

COMPONENT 7 — PARAMETER SLOTS:
Define 5–8 parameter placeholders that change between
uses. Each should have: name, description, and example.

TASK DESCRIPTION:
[Paste your task description from above]

FORMAT:
Use clear section headers. Number all rules and checklist
items. Use code blocks for the output schema template.

====================================================
STRESS-TEST BATTERY (run after generation)
====================================================

After generating the master prompt, run these 5 tests:

TEST 1 — EDGE CASE:
"Using the master prompt above, process this unusual
but valid input: [describe an edge case for your task].
Does the prompt handle it correctly?"

TEST 2 — MISSING DATA:
"Using the master prompt above, process this input where
[key parameter] is missing. Does the failure handling
catch it? Does it hallucinate the missing data?"

TEST 3 — OUT OF SCOPE:
"Using the master prompt above, process this request
that is outside the defined scope: [describe an out-of-
scope request]. Does the prompt correctly reject it?"

TEST 4 — ADVERSARIAL:
"Using the master prompt above, process this deliberately
tricky input: [describe something ambiguous, contradictory,
or misleading]. How does the prompt handle it?"

TEST 5 — SCALE EXTREME:
"Using the master prompt above, process an input that is
[much larger / much smaller] than typical. Does the output
maintain quality at this scale?"

====================================================
REPAIR TEMPLATE
====================================================

For each test failure, use this repair process:

FAILURE: [Which test failed]
SYMPTOM: [What went wrong in the output]
ROOT CAUSE: [Which component was insufficient]
FIX: [Specific change to the master prompt]

After each fix:
1. Re-run the failing test
2. Re-run all other tests (check for regressions)
3. Confirm all 5 tests pass

====================================================
COMPRESSION TEMPLATE
====================================================

After all tests pass, compress the master prompt:

KEEP (do not compress):
- All numbered constraints
- All failure handling rules
- Output schema
- Verification checklist
- Parameter slot names

REMOVE:
- Explanatory prose between sections
- Redundant instructions
- Examples within the prompt itself
- "Why" explanations (keep only "what")

TARGET: 40–60% shorter than the full version.

TEST: Run 3 standard inputs through the compressed
version. Compare output quality to the full version.
If quality drops, restore the compressed content.
